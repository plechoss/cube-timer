# pTimer - a speedcubing timer
A minimalistic speedcubing timer. The goal is to have a simple yet powerful timer that provides a lot of functionality when it comes to analyzing trends in your solves, data import/export and more. For now in development phase. Current functionality:
- random state scrambles
- avg5, avg12 and avg100 calculation, as well as best cases for all in the session
- scrambles along with inspection time and solve time saved in local storage
- modal window with details on a single solve, avg5, avg12 or avg100
- auto-generated external links to a solve reconstruction website
- one-click copying of the scrambles

## Run
Run using
```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
Start inspection with space (a touch on mobile), start the solve by holding down space (or your finger on the screen) for one second.
